# All-work-I-have-done
I'll be adding all the project I practice on here. It will be public so if anyone need any part of it, they can do so. Helping a fellow developer is what we should do.

An attendance report which holds all the attendance data and can be displayed in the form of a table.
A module for registered courses.
A module for grade report which records the academic status of a student.
